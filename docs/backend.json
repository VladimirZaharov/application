It leverages path-based ownership for user-created projects, enabling secure and efficient data access. The design avoids using `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing authorization data where necessary and uses structural segregation to enforce consistent security postures across collections.\n\nThe structure stores each project under its owner's document at `/users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}`. This approach naturally enforces ownership and simplifies security rules based on the requesting user's ID.  The `name` field must be unique. To ensure QAPs, we segregate user-owned data into user-specific subcollections."
